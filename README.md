## The Future of Bundlers: A Presentation

This is a small presentation:

- bundled using [Parcel](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel)
- coded using the [React Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) library

### Getting Started

A simple:

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```

is enough to get up and running.

_If you do run into trouble with the bundling phase, look for a `babel` config in a certain `package.json` inside of `node_modules`, this is a known [issue](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/13)_.
